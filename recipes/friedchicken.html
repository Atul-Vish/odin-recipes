        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Crispy chicken consists of chicken pieces that are coated with seasoned flour or batter 
            and then fried. The breading adds a crisp coating to the exterior while retaining juices 
            inside the meat. Fried chicken is tasty, but it does have a lot more fat and calories 
            compared to roasted chicken.
